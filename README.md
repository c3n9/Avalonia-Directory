# Chit-Chat
To make the communication within the company more efficient, a chat system is developed. This
system is designed to support the transmission of messages between individual employees and
groups of employees. To make this possible, the concept of "chat rooms" is used. A chat room always
includes at least two members. All messages that are sent in a chat room, are visible to all members
