# Hospital
Hospital provides a comprehensive view of hospital wards, allowing you to efficiently manage patient occupancy. Each  is visually represented, and you can easily see how many patients are currently occupying each one.

With our intuitive drag-and-drop feature, you can seamlessly move patients between words. Simply click and drag a patient's icon to the desired ward, and our system will automatically update the occupancy status accordingly.

Whether you're a healthcare professional looking to streamline patient management or a hospital administrator optimizing ward utilization, our application offers the tools you need for efficient and effective hospital operations.
